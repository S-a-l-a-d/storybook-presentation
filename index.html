                        ## The Evolution of Websites
                        
                        * Static <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
                        * Dynamic <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
                        * Single Page Application <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

                        Note: Websites used to be small. They were just static from the beginning.
                        There was too little we could do with a static website,
                        so here came the dynamic websites. But the users are demanding and technologies
                        have also evolved. SPA is now dominating over the market.


                        ## The Evolution of Websites
        
                        By using front-end frameworks, we are applying the *Component-Driven Development*
                        methodology to our web development.

                        Note:
                        We build user interfaces from the bottom up by starting with basic components
                        and combine them together to create the whole page.

                        ## The Problems

                        Note: As we keep building components and the app keeps growing,
                        that leads to a few problems.
                        ---
                        ## The Problems

                        * We may be building a component that already exists
                        ---
                        ## The Problems

                        * We cannot find the component we need

                        Component explorers

                        * Improved component discoverability
                        * Documentation
                        * Isolated component development

                        Note:
                        * We can now explore our components
                        * We can try every state of a component to see how it looks like

                        ## Storybook
                        
                        * Build user interfaces in isolation
                        * Mock hard to reach use cases
                        * Document use cases as stories
                        * Supercharge your workflow with addons

                        Note:
                        * Implement components and pages without needing to fuss with data, APIs, or business logic.
                        * Render components in key states that are tricky to reproduce in an app.
                        * Save use cases as stories in plain JavaScript to revisit during development, testing, and QA.
                        * Use addons to customize your workflow, automate testing, and integrate with your favorite tools.

                        ## Storybook

                        * Spot test in a glance
                        * Visual test appearance
                        * Unit test functionality
                        * Accessibility test

                        Note:
                        * Whenever you write a story you get a handy test case. Quickly browse stories to make sure your UI looks right.
                        * Pinpoint UI changes down to the pixel by comparing image snapshots of stories.
                        * Reuse stories in your unit tests to confirm nuanced functionality.
                        ---
                        ## Storybook

                        * Find any component or page in your app
                        * Get timely feedback during development
                        * Share components across screens and apps
                        * Generate user interface documentation automatically

                        <video data-autoplay data-src="assets/storybook-workflow-share-optimized-lg.mp4" style="height: 30vh;"></video>

                        Note:
                        * Storybook is a searchable, single source of truth for your UI.
                        * Publish Storybook online to give your team a universal reference point for feedback.
                        * Every story is a use case that your team can find and reuse.
                        * Write Markdown/MDX to generate a customizable site for component libraries and design systems.

                        ## Conclusion

                        * Develop durable user interfaces
                        * Test user interfaces with less effort
                        * Document user interface to share with your team

                        Note:
                        * Storybook provides a sandbox to build UIs in isolation so you can develop hard-to-reach states and edge cases.
                        * Stories are a reproducible way to keep track of UI edge cases. Write stories once then reuse them to power automated tests.
                        * Stories show how UIs actually work not just how they're supposed to work. That makes gathering feedback and reproductions easy.
